The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a robust Bluetooth-controlled 
embedded system based on the 8051-microcontroller architecture that can perform multiple 
communication and control functions through a seamless wireless interface. 
The specific technical objectives of this project include: 
1) Implementation of reliable serial communication between a mobile application and the 8051
microcontroller via Bluetooth. 
2) Development of a multi-modal operational framework that allows users to seamlessly 
transition between different functional modes. 
3) Design of a comprehensive LED control system. 
4) Integration of relay control capabilities.  
5) Creation of a Morse code translation. 
6) Development of a basic encryption/decryption system. 
7) Design of an interactive Morse code decoder. 
8) Implementation of a basic arithmetic calculator capable of performing fundamental 
mathematical operations on multi-digit numbers.
